# Design Patterns examples:
This projects contains design pattern examples, some of them obtained from the book **"Head First - Design Patterns"** from the authors "Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson".
This is an excellent book to learn more about Design Patterns.

## The current patterns contemplated in this projects are:
1. **_Observer_**: The **Observer pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
2. **_Decorator_**: The **Decorator pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
3. **_Factory Method_**: The **Factory method pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
